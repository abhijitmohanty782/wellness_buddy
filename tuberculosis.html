                <h2>About Tuberculosis</h2>
                <p>Tuberculosis, often abbreviated as TB, is a highly infectious bacterial disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This airborne pathogen primarily affects the lungs but can also target other organs, leading to a spectrum of symptoms ranging from persistent coughing, chest pain, and fever to weight loss and fatigue. TB remains a significant global health concern, particularly in developing countries and among vulnerable populations such as those with compromised immune systems or limited access to healthcare. Its transmission occurs through the inhalation of respiratory droplets expelled by individuals with active TB. Diagnosis typically involves chest X-rays, sputum tests, and other laboratory examinations. Treatment for TB typically involves a regimen of antibiotics taken over several months to eradicate the bacteria. Despite advancements in healthcare and treatment, challenges such as drug resistance and lack of access to care continue to impede efforts to eradicate TB worldwide. Vigilance, early detection, and comprehensive treatment strategies remain essential in combating this persistent infectious disease.</p>

                <h2>Tuberculosis Prevention</h2>
                <p>Treatment for tuberculosis (TB) typically involves a multidrug regimen aimed at killing the bacteria responsible for the infection and preventing the development of drug-resistant strains. The most commonly used drugs for TB treatment include isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide, often administered together for an initial intensive phase followed by a continuation phase. The duration of treatment can range from six to nine months or longer, depending on the severity and drug susceptibility of the infection. It is essential for patients to adhere strictly to their prescribed treatment regimen to ensure successful outcomes and prevent relapse or the development of drug resistance. Directly Observed Therapy (DOT), where healthcare workers or trained volunteers supervise medication intake, helps improve adherence and treatment outcomes. In cases of drug-resistant TB, treatment may involve second-line antibiotics, which are often more expensive and have more severe side effects. Close monitoring of patients for adverse reactions and regular follow-up evaluations are crucial components of TB treatment to ensure effectiveness and minimize complications.</p>
